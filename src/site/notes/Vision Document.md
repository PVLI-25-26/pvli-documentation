## Description
This 2D action-adventure follows a magic-wielding protagonist who ventures from a safe hub into a perilous magical realm. Each expedition begins by stepping through a portal into a shifting, hostile world filled with valuable resources, dangerous creatures, and hidden secrets.

Combat is entirely ranged and emphasizes precision, positioning, and tactical use of limited special arrows. Players must adapt to unpredictable encounters, navigate traps, and manage scarce resources to survive — and if they escape alive, they return stronger, with new tools and upgrades unlocked in the hub.

Dialogue with NPCs reveals the story and provides guidance, while responsive movement and special abilities allow for deep exploration of environments. The game combines fast-paced action with thoughtful progression, set in a mysterious, hand-crafted world where every run brings new opportunities — and new risks.


## Game Loop 
The game has a simple yet effective game loop:
1. Enter the dungeon with an equipment loadout.
2. Loot, explore and fight to obtain items, and exit alive from the dungeon to obtain gold.
3. Use the gold to buy better equipment and go to step 1.
