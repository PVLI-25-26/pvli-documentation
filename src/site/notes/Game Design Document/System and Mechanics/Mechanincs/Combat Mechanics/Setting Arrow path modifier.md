**Setting Arrow Path Modifier** â€“ a mechanic that allows the player to alter the trajectory and behavior of projectiles after they are fired. 
## Description
The player can equip two active arrow path modifier before entering the magical realm ([[Game Design Document/System and Mechanics/Systems/Equipment shop and coins\|Equipment shop and coins]]).  
This modifier changes the flight pattern of all fired projectiles, overriding the default arched trajectory and adding unique behavior.  
Modifiers can alter the number of projectiles, their spread, bounce behavior, and travel distance. It is used to adjust the area of effect, control coverage, or introduce tactical variety in ranged combat.

Only one path modifier can be active at a time, encouraging players to adapt their loadout to different enemy types and environments.

## Available Modifiers
- [[#Wave Shot]]
- [[#Triple Shot]]
- [[#Long Shot]]
- [[#Ricochet]]

### Wave Shot
Projectiles move in a **sine-wave pattern**, causing them to sway left and right as they fly.  
This increases the horizontal coverage of each shot, making it easier to hit fast or erratically moving targets.  
However, the unpredictable path slightly reduces precision and can be harder to aim at long distances.

### Triple Shot
Fires **three arrows** simultaneously in a **spread formation** (e.g., angled slightly outward).  
Each individual arrow deals **reduced damage**, but the total output can be high if all arrows hit the target.

### Long Shot
Increases the **initial velocity** of the arrow and reduces its trajectory curvature, allowing it to travel much farther in a **straighter line**.  
This modifier is best for long-distance combat or sniping enemies before they can close in.

### Ricochet
Arrows gain the ability to **bounce** off surfaces (walls, objects, possibly enemies) **multiple times** before losing momentum.  
Each bounce reduces velocity and damage slightly.  
Can be used to hit enemies hiding behind cover or around corners.
