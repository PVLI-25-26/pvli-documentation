**Items value specs** â€“ The value of the items will increase with the difficulty. This page describes how the value increases.
## Description
The value of items increases as the difficulty level increases. The value increments are specified for each item individually, not for the entire multiplayer game. Each item has values for three levels, which gives us more flexibility in designing how items work.
