**Difficulty counter** â€“  
## Description
There is a counter that keeps track of how many rooms the player has visited. When the player explores a new room, the counter increases.
There are some points in the counter where, once surpassed, the game gets harder.
For example: 4, 7, and 9. The difficulty increases when the player explores four rooms, then increases again when the player explores three more rooms, and then increases again when the player explores two more rooms.
