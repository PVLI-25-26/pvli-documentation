**Managing Quiver** â€“ a mechanic that allows the player to manage and switch between different types of projectiles. It is used to adapt combat strategy and is part of the following systems: combat and resource management.
## Description
The player can equip different types of arrows in the quiver, each with unique properties that affect combat strategy. Arrows are consumable items: when the player shoots, the corresponding arrow is removed from the inventory. To avoid running out, arrows must be picked up after being used. Stronger arrows are more limited in quantity, requiring the player to carefully manage resources and choose the right type of projectile for each encounter. This mechanic encourages strategic thinking and careful planning during exploration and combat.
