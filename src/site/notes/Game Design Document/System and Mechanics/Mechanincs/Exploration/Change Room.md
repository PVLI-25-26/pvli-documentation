**Change Room** â€“ a mechanic that allows the player to move between rooms.
## Description
Each room is hand-crafted and contains one or more doors or paths. When the player [[Game Design Document/System and Mechanics/Systems/Interaction\|interacts with a door]], they are transported to the connected room. The player spawns at the corresponding entry point in the new room, typically the path that leads back to the previous room.
