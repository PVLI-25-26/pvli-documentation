**Use Ability** – a mechanic that allows the player to use a special ability that affects movement. It is used to enhance exploration and mobility during fights. 
## Description
Before each expedition, the player can choose one active ability from a set of available abilities. Each ability is tied to a specific item that can be found in the magical realm, making exploration a key part of unlocking new movement options. Abilities modify the player’s movement in a unique way, for example by granting temporary invulnerability frames, or boosting speed. During the expedition, the selected ability can be activated by [[Game Design Document/Controls\|pressing the designated ability]] button. This mechanic encourages strategic planning before entering the magical realm and adds depth to traversal during exploration. Abilities are limited to one active choice per expedition, making the selection meaningful and impactful.
