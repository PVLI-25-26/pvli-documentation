**Manage Quiver** â€“ a mechanic that allows the player to manage and switch between different types of projectiles.
## Description
The player can equip two different types of arrows in the quiver, each with unique properties that affect combat strategy. Arrows are consumable items: when the player shoots, the corresponding arrow is removed from the inventory. 

The player can quickly change arrows in the middle of combat to use both arrows properties using [[Game Design Document/Controls\|change arrow key]].

Arrows are a limited resource as the player can only have a certain number of arrows in their inventory. Arrows must be picked up after being used, making shooting arrows more than just shooting everywhere. 

Stronger arrows are more limited in quantity, requiring the player to carefully manage resources and choose the right type of projectile for each encounter. This mechanic encourages strategic thinking and careful planning during exploration and combat.
