**Item progression** â€“ The value of the items will increase with the difficulty. This page describes how the value increases.
## Description
[[Game Design Document/System and Mechanics/Mechanincs/Item Mechanics/Consumable items\|Consumable items]]s increase in value as the player explores the dungeon ([[Game Design Document/System and Mechanics/Systems/Difficulty system\|Difficulty system]]). This increased value is represented as an increase in the item's statistics and associated gold value.
This ensures that the player is rewarded if they are capable of surviving for longer. As the enemies also increase in strength, the items will give the player stronger buffs when consumed, making them still worth the consumption even if their value is higher.

The value of items increases in three levels (`I`, `II` and `III`)  with `I` being the lowest and `III` the highest.
