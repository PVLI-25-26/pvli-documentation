**Missions mechanic** â€“  How missions work and where they appear.
## Description
Missions only appear during a run, and the rewards are consumable items.
A mission can be given by an NPC or an object. 
The mission will require completing certain objectives, such as killing a certain number of enemies or giving a certain number of consumables.
A mission is completed when the player returns to the mission point, either to hand over items or after completing the objective.
Missions are random and may repeat in other runs.
Each mission has its own room.
