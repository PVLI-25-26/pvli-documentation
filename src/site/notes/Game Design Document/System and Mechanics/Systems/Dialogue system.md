**Dialogue system** â€“ This is a system that describes how players can interact with NPCs or objects.

## Description
The player will be able to interact with non-player characters (NPCs) and objects using the same system.
When the player interacts with an NPC, a bubble will appear over the character. The text that the NPC is saying will be displayed in this bubble. Below the bubble, there will be one or two options for responses. Next to the bubble will be a portrait of the character.
Interacting with an object (opening a door, a crate, or entering the dungeon) works the same way, but instead of a portrait, there will be a drawing, and instead of dialogue, there will be a narrative description.

## Dynamics
The player will have a better view of the appearance of the NPC who is speaking. 
The UI will be over the interactive target, making it more immersive.
