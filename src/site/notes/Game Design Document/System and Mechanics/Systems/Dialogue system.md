**Dialogue system** – a versatile system that describes how players can interact with NPCs or objects.

## Description
Through this system, the player will be able to interact with non-player characters (NPCs) and objects.
When the player interacts with an NPC, a bubble will appear over the character. The text that the NPC is saying will be displayed in this bubble. Below the bubble, there will be one or two options for responses. Next to the bubble will be a portrait of the character.
Interacting with an object (opening a door, a crate, or entering the dungeon) works the same way, but instead of a portrait, there will be a drawing, and instead of dialogue, there will be a narrative description.

## Dynamics
Having a common yet versatile system for all non-combat interactions in the game is a great way to simplify the experience for the player, reducing the amount of systems one has to learn to play the game.
The player will have a better view of the appearance of the NPC who is speaking. 
The UI will be over the interactive target, making it more immersive.
