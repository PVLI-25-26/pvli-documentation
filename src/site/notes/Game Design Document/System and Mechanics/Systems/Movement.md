**Movement System** – a core system that governs the player’s traversal through the In-game world, including running, dodging, and using abilities.
## Description
The player moves through the 2D room, in a continuous way. Rooms have a defined size and the player will not be able to move beyond the room´s edge.
When the player traverses one of the room´s paths, they will go to another room.

The player will collide with static objects in the room (trees, structures, stones, ...), but will be able to move through enemies and other dynamic entities such as objects or NPCs.

Player movement is not accelerated, it is a constant velocity. Due to the keyboard limitations (the most commonly used input in web), the direction in which the player moves is discrete, and only within the values of 8 directions.
Player movement may be altered through the different player abilities.
## Dynamics 
The player must feel like his character is completely under his control, with precision and accuracy. Movement must feel responsive and fast, but especially satisfying, as it will be what the player does most often.
