**Inventory system** â€“ This system shows how inventory works throughout its entire life cycle, from when the player enters the dungeon until they exit..

## Description
Players will be able to collect items during the run. Each item is a consumable with a price. 
The inventory is infinite, so the player can take as many items as they want.
The inventory is represented as a list.
When the player exits the run, all the items are sold.
## Dynamics
The player can choose to consume the item or keep it until the end of the run to sell it. If an item has a very good buff, its value will also be high.
