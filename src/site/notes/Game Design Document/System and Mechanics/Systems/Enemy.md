**Enemy System** â€“  a system responsible for managing enemy types, behaviors, and interactions with the player.
## Description
The Enemy System defines the different types of enemies that populate the game world, including small enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses. It specifies their behavior patterns, attack styles, movement logic, and interactions with the player and the environment. The system ensures that each encounter feels unique and requires players to adapt their strategy according to enemy type and behavior.
## Enemy types
#TODO `List of enemies`
## Dynamics
Players must observe enemy patterns, react to attacks, and prioritize targets based on behavior and threat level. Variety in enemy types encourages experimentation with combat strategies, positioning, and use of abilities. Environmental interactions, such as traps or cover, further influence enemy behavior and encounter dynamics.
