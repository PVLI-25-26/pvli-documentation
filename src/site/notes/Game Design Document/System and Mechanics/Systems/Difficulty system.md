**Difficulty system** â€“  This system shows how the game increases in difficulty throughout the playthrough.

## Description
The dungeon is made up of rooms. When the player enters an unexplored room, a number is added to a counter. Once the counter reaches a certain point, the game becomes more difficult.
## Dynamics
The player must hurry before the game becomes very difficult, making it more dynamic.
Players must decide whether to explore more rooms and acquire more resources, which makes the game harder.
The player can wait to enter a room, then enter later when it's harder for better items.
