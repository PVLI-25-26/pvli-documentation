**Missions system** â€“ This system explains how missions work and how players are rewarded for completing them.

## Description
Inside the dungeon, the player may encounter NPCs who will offer him missions in exchange for some items. The player can accept any number of missions with the [[Game Design Document/System and Mechanics/Systems/Dialogue system\|Dialogue system]].
If the player dies or exits the dungeon, all of his currently active missions will disappear.

Missions are randomized and varied. Some missions might ask the player to explore a certain room, pick up an object or defeat several number of enemies. 

Once a mission is completed, the player can return to the NPC offering said mission to obtain the reward.

Missions also have a story behind them, it can be a simple story or a more complex lore related narrative. They help the player learn about the world and it's inhabitants through interactions with NPCs and objects.

## Dynamics
Missions help give players a secondary objective within the run besides killing the boss. They also serve as a way to obtain valuable items, and to learn about the lore of the game. 
When encountering an NPC, the player must decide whether it is worth completing the mission offered by the NPC or not, or whether the mission goals align somewhat with his own personal goals.
