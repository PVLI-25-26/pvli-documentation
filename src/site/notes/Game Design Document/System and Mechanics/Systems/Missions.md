**Missions System** â€“ a system that manages mission progression and rewards players upon their completion.
## Description

Before entering the dungeon for the first time the player encounters an NPC that will give him a mission: "Enter the dungeon and come back alive".

After completing this first mission the Shop will be unlocked.

From this moment onwards the missions will vary depending on the data gathered from the runs with the objective of making the player try different types of gameplays, for example if the player is focused on recollecting items but not engaging in battle, the npc will give the player missions to subjugate monsters. The missions can go from collecting specific items from the dungeon to killing some type/quantity of enemies.

Completing a mission will grant you benefits in the shop, making upgrades and consumables cheaper, and also will unlock the different types of Arrows.
