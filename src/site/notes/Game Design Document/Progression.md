## Player Progression

> [!info] Progression
> The progression system defines the sequence of challenges and key milestones the player experiences during a run, from the beginning to the end of the game.
### Sequence of a Run
1. **Entering the Dungeon** – The player begins the run at the dungeon entrance with starting resources, abilities, and equipment. Before each run, the player can also stock up in the shop with all necessary items.

2. **Room Exploration** – players explore rooms, encounter enemies, NPCs and find consumables and lore-related things.

3. **Combat Encounters** – players fight enemies using movement, attacks, and consumables to survive.

4. **Progression Milestones** – players reach key rooms. This can include unlocking new areas, gaining new abilities, or facing stronger enemies. Additionally, players can **exit the dungeon** to safely carry out collected resources without losing them, converting it to gold for getting better loadout next time.

5. **Boss Encounters** – major battles occur at designated points. Bosses test the player’s skill in combat, positioning, and resource management.

6. **Run Completion** – The player exits the dungeon either successfully or fails by losing all health/resources. Rewards are granted based on achievements and collected items.

Each run is accompanied by skill progression and **meta-progression**, such as unlocking new loadouts with different weapon modifiers, which influence the player’s strategy.
